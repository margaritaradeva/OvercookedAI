  <h1 class="title">Welcome to Overcooked-AI</h1>
  <p class="text-center">This page provides essential instructions for participating in the cooperative cooking game. You’ll learn about the kitchen layout, actions you can perform, and your goals as a player.</p>

  <div>
    <h2 class="section-title">Kitchen Layout</h2>
    <p class="subsection">Below is an example of a kitchen layout. You and your partner chef must cooperate to prepare and serve onion soups efficiently. Various stations such as ingredient boxes, pots, dish areas, and serving counters are placed around the kitchen.</p>
    <img src="static/images/training0.png" alt="Game Layout" class="instruction-img">
    <p class="subsection">This layout contains labeled areas to help you understand where to obtain and place items:</p>
    <img src="static/images/training0-annotated.png" alt="Annotated Layout" class="instruction-img">

    <h2 class="section-title">Movement and Interaction</h2>
    <img class="instruction-img" src="static/images/space-arrows.png" alt="Movement Arrows">
    <p class="subsection">Use the <strong>arrow keys</strong> to move up, down, left, or right. You can interact with adjacent objects by facing them and pressing the <strong>spacebar</strong>. Interactions include:</p>
    <ul class="subsection">
      <li>Picking up ingredients or dishes.</li>
      <li>Placing ingredients on empty counters or in pots.</li>
      <li>Starting to cook a soup in a pot (must contain 1–3 ingredients).</li>
      <li>Picking up completed soup and placing it in the serving area.</li>
      <li>Dropping incorrect items at the serving counter to dispose of them.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="subsection"><strong>Note:</strong> Players cannot occupy the same tile as each other.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Cooking Soups</h2>
    <p class="subsection">Soups require 1–3 ingredients placed into a pot. Once a pot has ingredients, interact again with the pot to begin cooking. You must then wait until cooking is complete before serving.</p>
    <p class="subsection">Cooking time and reward points vary depending on the combination of ingredients. Once a soup is served, it is removed from the orders list.</p>
    <p class="subsection">After cooking, transfer the soup into a dish and bring it to the serving counter.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Serving</h2>
    <p class="subsection">To serve a soup, place it in a dish and bring it to the grey serving counter. Successfully served soups are removed from the order list and score points if they match the active orders.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Soup Variations</h2>
    <p class="subsection">Below are all valid soup combinations using 1 to 3 ingredients. Each icon represents a different soup type based on the number of tomatoes and onions it contains:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Ingredients</th>
        <th>Icon</th>
      </tr>
      {% for num_tomatoes in range(layout_conf.max_num_ingredients + 1) %}
        {% for num_onions in range(layout_conf.max_num_ingredients + 1) %}
          {% if num_tomatoes + num_onions > 0 and num_onions + num_tomatoes <= layout_conf.max_num_ingredients %}
            <tr>
              <td>{{ num_onions ~ " Onion" if num_onions }} {{ num_tomatoes ~ " Tomato" if num_tomatoes }}</td>
              <td><img src="{{ "static/assets/new_sprites/soup_done_tomato_" ~ num_tomatoes ~ "_onion_" ~ num_onions ~ ".png" }}" style="width:60px;height:60px;background-color:#e6b453;"></td>
            </tr>
          {% endif %}
        {% endfor %}
      {% endfor %}
    </table>

    <h2 class="section-title">All Orders</h2>
    <p class="subsection">Only specific soup combinations will count towards your score. These are listed in the <strong>All Orders</strong> panel. Any soup not listed will earn 0 points.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Bonus Orders</h2>
    <p class="subsection"><strong>Bonus Orders</strong> are a highlighted subset of All Orders. Serving these soups grants extra points by multiplying the base score.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Scoring</h2>
    <p class="subsection">Your total score depends on which soups you serve and whether they match the order list or bonus list. Avoid serving soups not listed in All Orders to prevent wasting time.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Game Objective</h2>
    <img class="instruction-img" src="static/images/info-panel.png" alt="Score Panel">
    <p class="subsection">Your objective is to maximize your team’s score by serving as many valid soups as possible before time runs out. Keep track of remaining time, active orders, and score using the information panel below the kitchen layout.</p>
