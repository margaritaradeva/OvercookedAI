# Design and Implementation of Human–AI Cooperation in a Video Game

**Author:** Margarita H. Radeva 

---

## Overview  
This repository contains the **Overcooked-AI** benchmark environment in which a human player can team up with a Jason symbolic AI agent to prepare and serve soups under time pressure. It provides the game server, frontend UI, and Docker configurations needed to launch the kitchen simulation.

> **Note:** This is one of **two** repositories required for the complete system. You will also need the [Symbolic AI Agent repo](https://github.com/margaritaradeva/SymbolicAIAgent).

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed on your system:

- **Python** 3.8 or higher  
- **Docker**
- **Git Bash** (set as your default terminal, e.g. in VS Code, if using Windows)
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)  

> All of the additional requirements are installed via Docker itself

---

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone this repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/margaritaradeva/OvercookedAI.git
   cd overcooked_ai/src/overcooked_demo
   ```
2. **Build the Docker images and start the Flask server**
   ```bash
   ./up.sh
   ```
3. **Wait until you see a message like this in the terminal:**
   ```bash
   Running on ......... (Press CTRL+C to quit)
   ```
4. **When you are done, stop the container**
   ```bash
   ./down.sh
   ```

---

## Usage
1. Open your browser at http://localhost
2. Select a **kitchen layout** and **game time**, then click **Create**.
3. In a separate terminal, follow the **Symbolic AI Agent** README to launch the Jason agent (jason kitchen.mas2j).
4. The agent will join automatically as Player 2. Play together and observe real-time human–AI coordination!
